    <p>It’s that time of year again, (up until feb 25) time to figure out what presentations we want to see at the OpenStack summit. And yes, your votes help ensure that I’ll have a chance to present. Here are a couple presentations that I am in, as well as others that I think should be on the docket.</p>

<p>If you think these will be of value to the community, please use your vote to ensure that they will get on the schedule (click on the link tittles to get to the voting pages). </p>

    </h3>
    
    <h4>
      Colin McNamara — Chief Cloud Architect / Director Cloud Practice at Nexus IS
    </h4>
    
    <p>
      Let me tell you a dirty little secret. While OpenStack is a great project, it is extremely complicated for and indivdual with an engineering/operations focus vs a programming focus to get to their first code contribution.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      My name is Colin, I am and engineer. Although I initially got involved with OpenStack in the context of operations, I quickly was drawn into actually contributing code to the project. What I found is that many of the tools and workflows used to contribute to OpenStack are completely foreign to those (like me) with an operations focus.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      In this session I will go over the biggest challenges that I faced as an engineer contributing. And review the  tools and techniques to that I used to get past them. This information will be presented with the goal of arming engineers just getting involved with the knowledge tools necessary to get to their first successful contribution and beyond.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      Learning objectives
    </p>
    
    <p>
      1. The importance of community &#8211; Leveraging the power of the meeting
    </p>
    
    <p>
      2. Talking your employeer into supporting OpenStack and the CLA
    </p>
    
    <p>
      3. Setting up your dev environments &#8211; getting beyond Devstack
    </p>
    
    <p>
      4. Getting git, using the git repository for those that don&#8217;t code for a living
    </p>
    
    <p>
      5. Testing your code &#8211; what do you mean it doesn&#8217;t build?
    </p>
    
    <p>
      6. How to give back, and get other people involved in the community.

      This session will be a panel where we will discuss how to build and run your own OpenStack Meetup. The panelists have varying experience around this, from Sean running one of the largest and longest tenured OpenStack Meetup groups, to Mark starting a brand new group in the RTP area. We will discuss what makes a succesful group, strategies for forming and running your own group, and how community organizers can work together to share content and enable others to be succesful with their own group

      <p>
        This session is a 201 level technical deep dive on the <strong>VMware/Nicira Network Virtualization Platform (NVP)</strong>. NVP is a virtual networking platform powering many OpenStack production environments as the networking engine behind Quantum. In this session we’ll explore the distributed systems architecture of the NVP Controller Cluster, the core functionality and behavior of NVP’s primary system components, and the logical networking devices and security tools NVP produces for consumption. High availability deployments, and packet flows for common scenarios will be discussed. And finally, we’ll take a look at how the physical network fabric can be architected for NVP deployments.

        Boris from Russia here… We do much OpenStack at Mirantis. Much customer ask us to make cloud controller is highly available. Also much customer is cheap and ask only free, open source stuff in their cloud. At Mirantis we like make customer happy, so we make puppet recipe to make very highly available OpenStack for free. In this talk I make simple demonstration that even a goat that had a lot of vodka can understand how is use open puppet recipes to make highly available OpenStack and pay zero rubles to anyone. Also, a goat.

            This hands on lab will provide an oppurtunity to see how easy it is to use Puppet to deploy OpenStack environments.

            It will cover the architectural details of the Puppet modules used for installation, and explain how to easily get up and going with a fully functional OpenStack environment.

            Requirements: This lab assumes that you have a laptop with the following installed:
