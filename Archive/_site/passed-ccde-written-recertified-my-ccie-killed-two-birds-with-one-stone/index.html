    <p>Today was a good day, I knocked two major items of my todo list. The first, was passing the CCDE written.</p>

<p><a href="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/wp-content/gallery/ccde/passed-ccde.jpg"><img class="ngg-singlepic ngg-none" src="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/wp-content/gallery/ccde/thumbs/thumbs_passed-ccde.jpg" alt="passed-ccde.jpg" /></a>{.thickbox}</p>

<p>This is the first step towards sitting for a practical examination that will hopefully be released this October. And, in response to <a href="http://www.networkworld.com/community/node/24239" target="_blank">Micheal Morris’s blog post</a> – Yes Mike, I can pass the CCDE written.</p>

<p>The second big item on my todo list was to recertify my CCIE. Thankfully, Cisco counts the CCDE written towards my recertification requirements. I am waiting for the system to update, but I think this will set me up to be certified till June of 2011.</p>

<p>There is one interesting side effect of passing my CCDE written the week before networkers. I had originally planned on using the free exam at networkers as a “safety” exam in case I struck out on this attempt. Now of course, that is not necessary. Since I am already a CCIE, there isn’t much incentive to take a professional level exam.</p>

<p>So, after weighing my options, I have decided to take the CCIE Service Provider written. It covers much of the MPLS / IP Next Generation Networks material that I have been studying. I only have 7 days to prepare, so the odds are against me. However, with the heavy service provider focus in the CCDE blueprint, I have a feeling after I battle the CCDE practical I will be set to roll right into the CCIE Service Provider lab.</p>
