    <p>OK, normally I can say nothing bad about VMware. However today I can definately say that I have gone past annoyed. Let me set the mood for you.<br />
At work we have a pretty decent VMware envioronment. We have an IBM Blade Center, Gig switches, hooked to a Netapp San. All and all pretty bitchen. Once of the things we run in VMware is our M$ Exchange 2003 staging envioronment, along with a working copy of Active Directory. Needless to say, this has to be seggregated from our production copy, or all sorts of hell breaks loose.</p>

<p>Now this system work pretty good, except when we have to do usability testing. Its just not the same on a XP image, as it is from your laptop, on wireless, at home.. etc etc. So we decide we need some sort of VPN solution into our Exchange staging environment. After not alot of thought, I decide to set up a linux PPTP server. Its a protocol that pretty much everybody can use, pretty lightweight, and free ;).</p>

<p>I have set these boxes up before, and its not terribly hard. Until I had to do it on VMware. Let me set the stage for you – Redhat AS 3.3 / VMware Esx server / VMware tools installed / 1 nic . One NIC generally isn’t best for a VPN server, so I used Virtual Center to deploy a 2nd NIC to my PPTP box.<br />
For anyone reasonably familiar with Redhat or Manadrake, we are used to installing well known hardware and seeing Kudzu add it on boot. Not this time. I rebooted, Kudzu came.. Kudzu went. I ran Kudzu manually no dice.</p>

<p>I know I know, auto anything never works… So I moved on to manually defining this network adapter. The first thing to check – is it actually plugged in. LSPCI reports the adapter as plugged in, and recognises it as a pcnet32 adapter. Normally I would take this as a positive sign, but not today. I issue IFCONFIG -a , network adapter is still not found. I was definately feeling a bit frustrated at this point. To be sure it wasn’t me, I bugged a friend and a co-worker (remind you of a game show?). Anson, who runs the VMware enviornment tried removing VMware tools, adding them…. still no dice. Shad tried to help through Yahoo, although to no avail.</p>

<p>By this time, I am frustrated, feeling like a moron, and ready for a break.<br />
I went to get lunch from the Cafe, and settled down to eat at my desk.<br />
Funny thing, how when you aren’t thinking about a problem is when you normally think of the solution. Let me give you a little background. Earlier when we were troubleshooting this problem, I googled this usenet post –
<a href="http://content.ix2.net/arc/t-4236.html">http://content.ix2.net/arc/t-4236.html</a> . This fellow describes his headaches with debian, in which he had a very similar problem.</p>

<p>His problem, along with mine was that the proper modules werent loading for his network devices. He had tried, along with me to add the module listing to /etc/modules.conf. The one thing however that I hadn’t tried was manually loading pcnet32 using modprobe.</p>

<p>needless to say, modprobe pcnet32 now sits in my rc.local file. Its lame, but it works.</p>
