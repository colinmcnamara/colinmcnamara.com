<p style="font-family: Arial;">
  <span style="font-family: Arial;">Just over a month ago, the OpenStack Foundation announced the OpenStack Ambassador Program. The aim of this program is to create a framework of community leaders to sustainably expand the reach of OpenStack around the world.</span>
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial;">
  <img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="openstack-ambassador.png" alt="openstack ambassador" src="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/wp-content/uploads/2013/09/openstack-ambassador.png" width="430" height="539" border="0" />
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial;">
  While filling out the application, I realized that I was a bit more active over the past couple years then I have realized. I also figured, that this is something I should share on my blog, as social media is one of the key assets that I can bring to the program.
</p>

<p style="font-family: Arial;">
  <span style="font-family: Arial;"><strong>Below is my application to the program &#8211;  </strong></span>
</p>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: Why are you applying to be an OpenStack Ambassador ?
</h3>

<div style="font-family: Arial;">
  I want to increase my impact on the community by lowering barriers to adoption and increasing contribution to OpenStack.I feel there is a parallel with my OpenStack experience to my experiences with Linux in the 90&#8217;s. Back then I found a platform that changed how I ran my ISP. But I wasn&#8217;t able to really get it going until I we started organizing into groups in the community and started lowering the barriers to entry as a community.I feel that I can use the lessons learned then and since to increase Visibility, Adoption and Contribution to OpenStack.
</div>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: How have you participated in the OpenStack community to date ?
</h3>

<ul>
  <li>I am an OpenStack ATC, with contributions to Folsom, Grizzly and Havana though I feel my most impactful contributions have been in the community not the code base.</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">I am active in SFbay OpenStack meetup group that Sean Roberts leads. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">I have helped three OpenStack meetup groups get off the ground (Denver, Minneapolis, and RTP) and am in progress of getting a fourth one started in Alpharetta. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">In two of those groups, Denver and Minn, I have flown out to give the initial talk for the kickoff meetup. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">I developed and delivered multiple OpenStack presentation decks educating and enabling the community. Including “Surviving your first commit” which was delivered at the San Diego summit (and many users groups and events) and most recently “OpenStack for VMware admins” delivered at the #vBrownBag hall at VMworld San Francisco. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">I’ve helped multiple storage Vendors understand the why and how to develop and release integrations into Cinder. </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">Sean Roberts and I are the founding members of the training-manuals blueprint in OpenStack-Manuals. I have been focused on increasing core and community members, getting the CI system integrated, and ScrumBan (Project Management) </span></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">I’ve increased visibility and understanding of OpenStack through social media and my blog – </span><a style="font-family: Arial;" href="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/">www.colinmcnamara.com</a></li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">I’ve volunteered at the OpenStack booth at multiple conferences. </span></li>
  <li>I co-chaired the Strategy Track for the upcoming OpenStack Summit in Hong Kong</li>
  <li><span style="font-family: Arial;">Most importantly of all, I’ve had the pleasure of helping others join the community and get their first contribution in to OpenStack. </span><span style="font-family: Arial;"> </span></li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: What ideas do you have for your community that you haven&#8217;t had time or resources to implement ?
</h3>

<div style="font-family: Arial;">
</div>

<ul>
  <li>Holding consistent community delivered OpenStack training, lowering barriers to adoption of and contribution to OpenStack while increasing the pool of qualified engineers and developers.</li>
  <li>Extending this same concept to intellectually gifted but economically disadvantaged individuals and regions around the world.</li>
  <li>Spreading the word (separated from corporate FUD and occasional instances) about how to participate, extend, and replicate successful items that we are doing in the OpenStack community today.</li>
  <li>Formalizing a support and mentoring program for getting OpenStack meetups started in new communities.</li>
</ul>

<h3 style="font-family: Arial;">
  Q: How will you work with others to achieve your goals?
</h3>

<div style="font-family: Arial;">
</div>

<div style="font-family: Arial;">
  I feel the best way to impact a community is to spark and fan flames. I want to continue and increase this.How i will do this is best demonstrated by how and what i have been doing. Over the past two years I have worked with many individual around the world to achieve the goals of increasing visibility, knowledge, excitement, usage and contribution to OpenStack.I have worked with the following people most actively (Sorry if I miss anyone) to achieve that goal &#8211;
