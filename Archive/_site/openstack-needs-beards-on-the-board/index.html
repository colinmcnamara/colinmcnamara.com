    <p>Yes, we need more beards on the board. We need big full beards, that represent the interests of the user community. There needs to be a balance against the Manufacturer/Vendor interests that dominate OpenStack today. The great / sad fact is that 93% of commits to OpenStack come from corporate interests.</p>

<h2 id="why-more-beards-on-the-openstack-board">Why more beards on the OpenStack Board?</h2>

<p>What better exemplifies the interested of the OpenSource user then a full majestic beard attached to a guy in a who cares as much about the future of OpenStack as you do?</p>

<p>I am part of OpenStack because of many reasons. it reminds me of joining the Linux movement in the 90’s. The fate of technology is in the hands of us, the Operators. We have the ability to drive the direction and execution of OpenStack in a direction that benefits the end user as well as the corporate contributors.</p>

<h2 id="what-this-beard-has-done-for-the-community-so-far">What this beard has done for the community so far</h2>

<p>I’m not just a giant hippy. I’ve spent the last couple years executing on a passion for this great community and code base we call OpenStack.</p>

<ul>
  <li>I am an OpenStack ambassador.</li>
  <li>I am an Active Technical Contributor for Folsom, Grizzly and Havana (though my contributions pale in comparison to many others)</li>
  <li>I’ve helped many OpenStack user groups get off the ground</li>
  <li>I’ve been the hairiest booth babe ever at many OpenStack conference booths</li>
  <li>I’ve partnered with other users/operators just like me to start OpenStack training</li>
  <li>I’ve used my visibility in social media to influence many others to become users and contributors</li>
</ul>

<h2 id="vendor-employees-on-the-list">Vendor employees on the list</h2>

<p>I want to be completely fair to the vendor employees on the list. I know many of them personally, and they do an AMAZING job resisting the pressure to represent their corporations to represent those interests vs those of the community.</p>

<p>I am humbled every day by the amount of effort and contribution they give to OpenStack and the community. People like Kyle Mestery, Rob Hirschfeld, Monty Taylor make contributions to this community every day that I wish to someday rise to.</p>

<h2 id="vote-in-the-openstack-individual-directors-election">Vote in the OpenStack individual directors election</h2>

<p>You received an email on Sunday night prompting you to vote for the 2014 individual directors of the OpenStack foundation. If you search for “OpenStack Foundation – 2014 Individual Director Election” you should find it.</p>

<p><img style="display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;" title="voting-email.png" alt="OpenStack Voting Email" src="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/01/voting-email.png" width="500" height="224" border="0" /></p>

<p>This email gives you the chance to have your voice heard, and in my opinion provide balance to the force (between Vendors and Users). You have an opportunity to make your voice heard with the OpenStack individual directors election.</p>

<p>If you want a voice on the board who has the needs of the community firmly entrenched in his beard, then find your voting link email, scroll down to the bottom of that list, and <strong>vote for Colin McNamara</strong>.</p>
