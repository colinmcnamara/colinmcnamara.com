<p>The CCDE just got VERY real in a big way.The following announcement was posted in the <a title="CCDE - Cisco Learning Network" href="https://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/community/certifications/ccde;jsessionid=98786F300761C94A0E18F23F34D73639?view=overview" target="_blank">CCDE zone</a> at the <a title="Cisco Learning Network" href="https://cisco.hosted.jivesoftware.com/index.jspa?ciscoHome=true" target="_blank">Cisco Learning Network</a>. (If you haven’t checked the Cisco Learning Network out yet, I recommend it. Its like NetPro on steriods, but focused around certifications.)</p>

<blockquote>
  <p class="content">

Cisco has finished development of the second exam needed to attain the CCDE certification, the practical exam, and is now soliciting candidates for the beta delivery.
</p>

Exam beta pricing is $980US. <a href="mailto:ccdebeta@cisco.com" target="_blank"><strong>Register Now</strong> by email at:ccdebeta@cisco.com</a></p>

  For my CCIE, it always seemed like a switched turned the moment I put my credit card information in and secured a seat. Before that button was pushed, it was a &#8220;future&#8221; item to deal with. Once that button was pushed it was a &#8220;now&#8221; item. Things like going out, having a beer with the guys, video games, etc all got shut down so my focus could burn a hole in the subject matter.
</p>

<p class="content">
  I just sent in my registration email for the CCDE practical. I&#8217;ll be in Chicago Oct 1, ready to give it my all. But, the more important lesson I learned from my CCIE was that if you focus your efforts on your lab day, you will fail. However if you focus your efforts consistently over the months before, you have a chance of passing. Now that my registration email has been sent, it is time to turn that focus dial up, lock to the door to my office and earn the CCDE through months of hard work.
