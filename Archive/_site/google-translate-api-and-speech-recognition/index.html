    <p>Good morning,</p>

<p>It seems like the best idea’s always come in two places – The toilet and the shower. This morning I used both items, and had a pretty good idea bubble to the surface.</p>

<p>The idea, or should I say collection of ideas revolves around my inability to communicate in other languages. I try to work around this by using google translate, and texting back and forth. But even this fails in the event that I actually have to speek to someone. My only alternative then is to whip open my laptop, hop online, and type something out.</p>

<p>As I am writing this …. I just had a no crap eureka moment. My original direction and idea with this blog was to use speach recognition software to pipe text into a translation engine. This translated text would then be speach synthisysed back through your cell phone. This would be great, but I would think would have a long time to market.</p>

<p>So my no shit eureka moment – why not use SMS. The message is already in text format, limited to short sentances (reducing the likely hood of gross mistranslation). The idea being that whenever I need to speak spanish, it is generally short and to the point.</p>

<p>So the idea is to set up a sms server to collect sms messages. These messages would be piped into an API and sent off to google translate.<br />
The resulting text would then be sent back to the client handheld.</p>

<p>This text would then be sent back to the client, displayed on the handheld.<br />
The end user would read the response, alound. And hopefully communicate with the person.</p>

<p>This could build a working product user base, while a voice translation engine was being built from scratch.</p>

<p>Just my thoughts,<br />
