  <article class="post-content">
    <p>I spent the majority of last week at Cisco’s San Jose headquarters attending the Partner DataCenter Virtual Training. We spent three days going over new product releases, getting briefed and trained on new features as well as new products, as well as socializing with other engineers who focus on DataCenter technologies.</p>

<p>As with any vendor specific event, there is a mix of for public knowledge and for private consumption content, so I generally choose not to talk or write about subjects that may have been covered in the VT unless I can find some public documentation on that subject. So don’t expect to find any juicy pre-release information or gossip here. I don’t want to have the NDA police knocking at my door, and its just not cool to let stuff slip. So, I will generally avoid the subject.</p>

<p>What I can tell you is this – There is a lot of buzz about the Nexus 7000. It is a rocking platform, and we spent the majority of a day going over it. I can’t share much more then I did the night before the VT just yet (will wait till I get lab access to one) but I can share this.</p>

<p>Yes, most people are proud of their shots with Tom Cruise, or Oprah, Richard Stephens or BSD Girl. But I can Top that.. I have a picture of me and the Nexus 7000. <img src="http://www.colinmcnamara.com/wp-includes/images/smilies/simple-smile.png" alt=":)" class="wp-smiley" style="height: 1em; max-height: 1em;" /></p>

<p>The DC Channels team was nice enough to take us down to the DataCenter and Network Applications (DNA) lab. Where the Nexus 7000 has taken its new throne. They allowed to ooh and ahh and poke and prod it. Weirdly enough, the one thing that struck most was the attention to detail that went into the physical design of this chassis. It is not only good looking, but has some super usability enhancements that really impressed me.</p>
