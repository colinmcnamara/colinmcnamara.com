    <p>My CCIE Storage Shopping List</p>

<p>Lets just start this out by saying, darn.. this is going to be expensive.<br />
Now that that is out of the way, lets get started. Cisco publishes the hardware that is in the Storage lab.</p>

<p>Here is the hardware summary –</p>

<ul class="compact-bulleted">
  <li>
    Cisco Routers
  </li>
  <li>
    Cisco Catalyst Switches
  </li>
  <li>
    Cisco Secure Access Control System
  </li>
  <li>
    MDS 9506*
  </li>
  <li>
    MDS 9216*
  </li>
  <li>
    Port Analyzer Adapter
  </li>
  <li>
    JBOD
  </li>
  <li>
    RAID storage
  </li>
  <li>
    HBA
  </li>
  <li>
    3rd Party Fibre Channel Switch
  </li>
</ul>

<p>My guess is that this equals a basic routed network with a CS-ACS server on the backend.<br />
It looks like there is also at least 1 pc with an HBA connected into one MDS. The one big question I have is on the connected storage.<br />
My guess is that Cisco’s JBOD reference = Fibre Channel connected storage, and the RAID array mentioned is connected to at least one server.<br />
If my guess is right then there is the 9506 and 9216 – (note, no I in the name) and a third party switch.</p>

<p>So lets start the shopping list.</p>

<ol>
  <li>
    <p>Cisco Routers<br />
I have those coming out of the yinyang, no need to purchase anymore for this lab.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cisco Catalyst Switches<br />
Mine are a little old, but I don’t expect a storage exam to have anything challenging in the switching arena. No need to upgrade there.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Cisco Secure Access Control System<br />
Thankfully Cisco provides VAR’s with NFR binders. ACS will be loaded on HMB-SERVER1 in a vmware image. No expenditure needed.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MDS 9506*<br />
Holy smokes, this is a lot of money. I have seen them on ebay for $8,000. This includes both sup modules. I would need to buy a line card, which I see going for about 1k. so $9000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>MDS 9216<br />
Still bad, but not horrible. I just saw one on ebay for $5500. Depending on lab requirements it may be smart just to get to 9216’s. so $5500</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>Port Analyzer Adapter<br />
Best I can find is $2000 refurbished. I have a feeling practicing using this, and seeing the ethereal dumps is going to be integral to success. worst case this is 2k, best case beg or borrow $2000</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>JBOD<br />
Normally you are looking at 2-4k for one of these. My strategy is to find an old Netapp shelf, and low level format it. I found one on ebay that ends in 22 hours for $89. Sounds good to me.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>RAID storage<br />
I am going with my guess that this is just to facilitate data transfers between storage and host. My tactic is to use the existing storage inside one of my servers. $0</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>HBA<br />
Interesting – Only one HBA .This can be up to $2000 to buy new. Luckily ebay is my friend. I found a qlogic 2340 card for $50. My kind of deal</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>3rd party Fibre Channel Switch<br />
Luckily Brocade resells to everyone and their mother. IBM, Dell, HP, Compaq, ETC. I have found some Silkworm 2800’s for as low as $50 on ebay.<br />
I do have my eye on a 3800 that is going for $24 right now (I hope it stays low).</p>
  </li>
</ol>

<p>So how much is the damage?</p>

<p>$16,700</p>

<p>Holy smokes I could sell my truck just to buy the lab gear.</p>
