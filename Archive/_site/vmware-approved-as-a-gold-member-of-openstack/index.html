  <article class="post-content">
    <p>The last couple weeks has been interesting in how VMware will evolve its relationship with OpenStack. Many peoples eyebrows raised when they heard OpenStack mentioned during the keynote at VMworld. This caused the discussion about open source virtualization and how it impacts VMware to become top of mind for many.</p>

<p>One of the side discussions that came about was how the OpenStack board had put the application by VMware to become a gold member on hold. Many people quickly brought up thoughts of politics and scheming. Though from what I hear the main reason was because everyone is busy writing up by-laws and getting ready for the Folsom release.</p>

<p>Now it is time to put the drama to rest. VMware, as well as Intel and NEC were all approved as gold members on Friday by the board.</p>

<p>Welcome to the OpenStack Foundation VMware. We all look forward to seeing the contributed contributions from Nicira as well as the rest of the company.</p>
