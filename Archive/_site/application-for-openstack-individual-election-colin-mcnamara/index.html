    Q
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <h4>
      What is your relationship to OpenStack, and why is its success important to you? What would you say is your biggest contribution to OpenStack&#8217;s success to date?
    </h4>
  </div>
  
  <div>
    A
  </div>
  
  <div>
    <p>
      1. I am an OpenStack ATC, with contributions to Folsom, Grizzly and Havana though I feel my most impactful contributions have been in the community not the code base.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      2. I am active in SFbay OpenStack meetup group that Sean Roberts leads.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      3.I have helped three OpenStack meetup groups get off the ground (Denver, Minneapolis, and RTP) and am in progress of getting a fourth one started in Alpharetta.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      4. In two of those groups, Denver and Minn, I have flown out to give the initial talk for the kickoff meetup.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      5. I developed and delivered multiple OpenStack presentation decks educating and enabling the community. Including &#8220;Surviving your first commit&#8221; which was delivered at the San Diego summit (and many users groups and events) and most recently &#8220;OpenStack for VMware admins&#8221; delivered at the #vBrownBag hall at VMworld San Francisco.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      6. I&#8217;ve helped multiple storage Vendors understand the why and how to develop and release integrations into Cinder.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      7. Sean Roberts and I are the founding members of the training-manuals blueprint in OpenStack-Manuals. I have been focused on increasing core and community members, getting the CI system integrated, and ScrumBan (Project Management)
    </p>
    
    <p>
      8. I&#8217;ve increased visibility and understanding of OpenStack through social media and my blog &#8211; www.colinmcnamara.com
    </p>
    
    <p>
      9. I&#8217;ve volunteered at the OpenStack booth at multiple conferences.
    </p>
    
    <p>
      10. Most importantly of all, I&#8217;ve had the pleasure of helping others join the community and get their first contribution in to OpenStack.

          I am a member of the following working groups and boards

        <div>
          <h4>
            What do you see as the Board&#8217;s role in OpenStack&#8217;s success?
          </h4>

        <div>
          <p>
            The board has served multiple key purposes, but fundementally a seperate group of individuals focused on all the items that surround, but are no technical direction of OpenStack has been key to the projects success<em><strong>. </strong></em>The ability to create and sustain a successful govenernance model has been key to the success of the growth and success of the project so far.

      </div>
      
      <div>
        <h4>
          What do you think the top priority of the Board should be in 2014?
        </h4>
      </div>
      
      <div>
        A
      </div>
      
      <div>
        <p>
          Last time I checked, 92% of contributions to OpenStack are from corporate contributors. As we grow and marture as a project, I believe that we have to increase the individual and educational contributions to OpenStack. The board has a key role in achieving this goal.
